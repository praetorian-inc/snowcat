# Snowcat - A service mesh scanning tool

[![CI](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/snowcat/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](actions?query=branch%3Adevelopment)
[![Release](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/snowcat/workflows/Release/badge.svg)](releases)

Snowcat gathers and analyzes the configuration of an Istio cluster and audits it for potential violations of security best practices.

## Why We Built Snowcat

Like all cloud infrastructure, Istio requires some hardening effort beyond what a default deployment offers.
The [Istio Security Best Practices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/security/) document
covers this in great detail. This hardening process has a lot of moving parts and it's easy to miss
one of the steps that could assist an attacker in compromising a cluster. Snowcat was built to make
the detection of these missing hardening steps as straightforward as possible.

The two usage modes can help engineers analyze their clusters from different perspectives:

* The perspective of an attacker that has just obtained code execution on an Istio workload but without any other context or permissions.
* The perspective of a systems engineer that has the ability to dump all relevant configuration information for analysis.

By implementing analysis methods for both of these perspectives, Snowcat is able to gather a more "complete"
picture of the security posture of an Istio cluster.

## Install

You can install Snowcat locally by using any one of the options listed below.

### Install with `go install`

```shell
$ go install github.com/praetorian-inc/snowcat/cmd/snowcat@latest
```

### Install a release binary

1. Download the binary for your OS from the [releases page](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/snowcat/releases).

2. (OPTIONAL) Download the `checksums.txt` file to verify the integrity of the archive

```shell
# Check the checksum of the downloaded archive
$ shasum -a 256 snowcat_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.tar.gz
b05c4d7895be260aa16336f29249c50b84897dab90e1221c9e96af9233751f22  snowcat_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.tar.gz

$ cat snowcat_${VERSION}_${ARCH}_checksums.txt | grep snowcat_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.tar.gz
b05c4d7895be260aa16336f29249c50b84897dab90e1221c9e96af9233751f22  snowcat_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded archive

```shell
$ tar -xvf snowcat_${VERSION}_${ARCH}.tar.gz
```

4. Move the `snowcat` binary into your path:

```shell
$ mv ./snowcat /usr/local/bin/
```

### Clone and build yourself

```shell
# clone the Snowcat repo
$ git clone https://github.com/praetorian-inc/snowcat.git

# navigate into the repo directory and build
$ cd snowcat
$ go build

# Move the Snowcat binary into your path
$ mv ./snowcat /usr/local/bin
```

## Usage

There are two main modes of operation for Snowcat. With no positional argument,
Snowcat will assume it is running inside of a cluster enabled with Istio, and
begin to enumerate the required data. Optionally, you can point snowcat at a
directory containing Kubernets YAML files.

### Run Snowcat against static configuration information

```shell
# running with a directory specified will cause it to run in file analysis mode
./snowcat [options] <directory name>
```

### Run Snowcat in an Istio workload container

```shell
./snowcat [options]
```

### Run Snowcat in a cluster as a Job

```shell
# deploy snowcat to your cluster as a Job
$ kubectl -n default apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/praetorian-inc/snowcat/main/deploy/job.yaml
job.batch/snowcat created

# wait a few moments for the scan to complete

# review snowcat logs
$ kubectl -n default logs jobs/snowcat
...
time="2021-10-22T17:47:50Z" level=info msg="running auditor" auditor="Overly Broad Gateway Hosts"
time="2021-10-22T17:47:50Z" level=info msg="running auditor" auditor="Weak Service Account Authentication"
time="2021-10-22T17:47:50Z" level=info msg="found jwt policy" auditor="Weak Service Account Authentication" policy=third-party-jwt
snowcat job complete! use the following command to export the results:

kubectl -n default cp snowcat-46tj5:/data snowcat-results

# download results from the running pod
$ kubectl -n default cp snowcat-46tj5:/data snowcat-results
```

### Get Help

```shell
snowcat help
```

### Command Line Options

Snowcat comes equipped with several command line options to influence the
operation of the tool. Additionally, many configuration options can be passed
to the tool through a configuration file. By default, Snowcat looks for the
config file at `./snowcat.yml` (the directory from which the tool is run), but
can be passed as a switch to specify an arbitrary file location.

Configuration of Snowcat is handled by a combination of
[Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra "Cobra") and
[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper "Viper"). This allows Snowcat to be
configured through the following methods, in order of precedence.

1. Command Line Flag
2. Environment Variables
3. Configuration File

It should be noted that any data that is discovered during a run will overwrite
all configuration options.

The following configuration options can be specified:

* `-c <file>` `--config <file>` - the configuration file location (default:
  `./snowcat.yml`)

* `-l <level>` `--log-level <level>` - log level for console output, because
  logging is handled by [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus "Logrus"),
  the currently supported levels are trace, debug, info, warning, error, fatal,
  and panic. (default: `info`)

* `-s` `--save-config` - if this switch is passed, the configuration of Snowcat
  will be written out to the specified config file. This is useful if the tool
  is to be run multiple times on the same cluster to allow for fewer arguments
  to be passed in subsequent runs. NOTE: this will overwrite the existing config
  file every time.

* `--format [text|json]` - the output format for the tool, this is either `text`
  for human readable content, or `json` for structured output.

* `--export <directory>` - this flag will cause Snowcat to output the discovered
  Kubernetes resources to a directory as YAML files

* `--output <path>` - this flag will cause Snowcat to scan results to the
  specified file

* `--istio-version <version>` - if the Istio control plane version is known prior
  to running the tool, it can be passed via this flag. Additionally, it binds to
  the configuration variable `istio-version` in the configuration file.

* `--istio-namespace <namespace>` - if the namespace running the Istio control
  plane is known prior to running the tool, it can be passed via this flag.
  Additionally, it binds to the configuration variable `istio-namespace` in the
  configuration file.

* `--discovery-address <ip:port>` - this specifies the address of the
  unauthenticated XDS port. It is bound to the configuration variable
  `discovery-address`.

* `--debugz-address <ip:port>` - this specifies the address of the Istiod's debug
  API. It is bound to the configuration variable `debugz-address`.

* `--kubelet-addresses <list of ip:port>` - this specifies a list of kubelet nodes
  read-only API ports. It is bound to the configuration variable
  `kubelet-addresses`

* `--job-mode` - this flag is used in `deploy/job.yaml` to pause the snowcat binary
  and provide information to the user on how to extract results from a running
  container. NOTE: this is not useful outside the Job usage scenario.

To set these flags with environment variables, simply uppercase the
configuration variable name, and replace dashes with underscores, for example:
`istio-version` -> `ISTIO_VERSION`
